# Detecting Product Defects with Probability

## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to use Poisson distribution features to detect and predict defects for a given product. The project preamble states that the rate parameter of the Poisson is 7 defects per day.

This project seeks to investigate attributes of the Poisson distribution with the previously stated rate parameter. The analysis will be conducted using Jupyter Notebook.
